# Documentation Samples Sandbox

This project contains code samples used in articles from SciChart.Android documentation.

Each code sample is implemeted in:
- Java using SciChart Builders API, that was created to make declaration of chart and its parts more fluent;
- Java without using SciChart Builders API, where we use property setters/getters provided by chart and its parts directly;
- Kotlin without using SciChart Builders API, where we use Kotlin properties provided by chart and its parts directly and some syntax sugar provided by Kotlin (e.g. [apply()](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html) and so on), which allows to reduce amount of boilerplate code.
